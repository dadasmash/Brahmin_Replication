# Brahmin_Replication
This is the replication package for our I4R Discussion Paper "Replication Report: A Comment on Gethin, Martínez- Toledano & Piketty (2022)"(https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/268753/1/I4R-DP019.pdf)

***README FOR REPLICATION REPORT: A COMMENT ON GETHIN, MARTÍNEZ-TOLEDANO & PIKETTY (2022)***

*Do-files for replicating figures 5-8 in the report are available in the "Da" folder*

"Da_submit_figures.do" is the do-file to replicate figures 5, 6, 7 and 8 in "Replication Report A comment on Gethin, Martínez-Toledano & Piketty (2022)".

"Da_submit_pop_cleaning.do" is the do-file to clean the population data from the World Bank.

"Repli_Data_for_Figure" is the folder to store results generated by "Da_submit_figures.do" and "Da_submit_pop_cleaning.do", if you don't want to re-run the entire replication process, you can use file in this folder to replicate figures 5, 6, 7 and 8.



*Do-files for replicating figures 1-4 and 9-10 in the report are available in the "Do" folder*

These do-files should be run together with the replication package provided by the authors' of the original paper in the Harvard Dataverse, https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/XUSWG6, by replacing the "Do" folder in that replication package with the one provided here. Changes that have been done for this report are commented with the word "REPLICATION" in the do-files.
